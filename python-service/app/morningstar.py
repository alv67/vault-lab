"""Morningstar exposure resolver (custom, no mstarpy).

Morningstar's public pages sit behind an AWS WAF challenge and their legacy
`global.morningstar.com` JSON endpoints (used by mstarpy) are hard-blocked. This
resolver instead:

1. Bootstrap phase (lazy, cached): launches a headless Chromium under Xvfb,
   loads www.morningstar.com until the AWS WAF JS challenge auto-resolves, then
   reads the `aws-waf-token`/session cookies and fetches the MAAS bearer token
   from /api/v2/stores/maas/token. The bearer token is a JWT that authorizes the
   SAL service and expires after ~1 hour.
2. ISIN -> securityId lookup: GET /api/v2/search?q={isin} (works with the WAF
   cookies alone).
3. Data phase (plain requests, using the cached bearer + cookies):
      * https://www.us-api.morningstar.com/sal/sal-service/etf/portfolio/v2/sector/{sid}/data
        -> sector exposure, bucketed by asset class (EQUITY/FIXEDINCOME/...)
      * https://www.us-api.morningstar.com/sal/sal-service/etf/portfolio/regionalSectorIncludeCountries/{sid}/data
        -> country exposure ({fundPortfolio.countries[].name/percent}) — the
           payload already contains the full country list (51 entries, many zero);
           the website only paginates the client-side table 10 rows at a time.
      * https://www.us-api.morningstar.com/sal/sal-service/etf/portfolio/regionalSector/{sid}/data
        -> official region breakdown ({fundPortfolio.{regionKey: weight}}); the
           keys map 1:1 to canonical VaultLab region names.

The cached WAF session can be revoked before the bearer JWT expires, and then
the APIs answer with an HTML challenge page instead of JSON; every data flow
is therefore retried once with a fresh browser bootstrap (see
_retry_on_waf_challenge). Browser bootstrap crashes (a "session not created:
Chrome instance exited" caused by orphaned Chromium processes left by earlier
failed boots) are likewise retried once after a best-effort process cleanup
(see _browser_bootstrap_with_cleanup / _kill_stale_browsers).

Return-shape notes (confirmed from the live SAL service):
  * countries: name is a Morningstar camelCase country key (e.g. "southKorea",
    "czechRepublic", "unitedStates"); percent is a 0-100 number.
  * sectors: top-level buckets "EQUITY", "FIXEDINCOME" (note: no underscore in
    the live payload), each holding fundPortfolio.{camelCase GICS key: weight}.
    A sector bucket with all weights <= 1.0 is normalized to percentages.
