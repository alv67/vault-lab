-- VaultLab — manual price seed for the ISOLATED test stack only
-- (project vaultlab-test, DB vaultlab_test, port 8081, Yahoo finance disabled).
--
-- The test stack exposes no HTTP writer for prices (the only writer,
-- Price.Create, is used by the Yahoo fetcher which is disabled here), so the
-- portfolio allocation weights stay 0 until prices are seeded directly in the DB.
--
-- Run it against the test stack ONLY, NEVER against dev/prod (real data):
--
--   docker compose -p vaultlab-test -f docker-compose.test.yml exec -T postgres psql -U vaultlab -d vaultlab_test < tests/seed-prices.sql
--
-- Idempotent: re-running overwrites the same (asset_id, date) rows via
-- ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE, so reruns are safe.
