# Third-party licenses

This folder documents the open-source components used by VaultLab and the
licenses they are distributed under. VaultLab itself is released under the
[MIT License](../LICENSE).

## Scope

The inventory below lists **direct runtime dependencies** (the components
actually shipped and executed). Development-only tooling (linters, test
runners, TypeScript, Vite plugins) and transitive/indirect dependencies are
intentionally excluded from the table: they are not redistributed and their
licenses are tracked upstream.

The `License` column reports the license declared by each upstream package.
The authoritative license text always lives inside the package itself
(e.g. `node_modules/<pkg>/LICENSE`); no license texts are vendored here on
purpose, so they stay in sync with the pinned versions.

## Inventory

## Regenerating this inventory

When dependencies change, update the tables above and verify the licenses with
the following tools.

Go (installs `go-licenses`, then reports all modules):

```bash
go install github.com/google/go-licenses@latest
cd backend && go-licenses report ./... > /tmp/go-licenses.csv
```

Frontend (lists production dependencies with their license):

```bash
cd frontend && npx license-checker --production --summary
```

Python (lists installed packages with their license):

```bash
cd python-service && pip install pip-licenses && pip-licenses --format=markdown --with-urls
```

## Notes

- The tooling configuration in `.opencode/` is development-only and is not
  part of the distributed application, so it is not listed here.
- Apache-2.0 components require preserving their `NOTICE` files if any are
  present; this is handled automatically because the dependencies are installed
  from their published packages and not modified.
