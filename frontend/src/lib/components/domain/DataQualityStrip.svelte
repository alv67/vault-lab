  /**
   * Vault-level data-quality strip (EPIC K.3a, redesign spec §6.1/§8.5): a
   * thin row of warning chips rendered only when at least one item is
   * actionable; every chip is a link to the surface that fixes it (currency
   * whitelist for missing FX, Data & Sync for the price feed).
   *
   * Scope note: the spec also sketches "missing sectors/countries" and
   * "stale prices" vault counters, but none of them exists on the `Dashboard`
   * payload today — rendering guesses would be dishonest (the trust principle
   * behind §8.5). They need a backend field first (K.3 fast-follow ask);
   * until then this strip consumes only `summary.fx_missing_count` /
   * `fx_missing_value` plus the outcome of the session price refresh.
