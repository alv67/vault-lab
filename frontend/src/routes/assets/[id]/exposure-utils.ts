 * bypass these helpers and stay blocked by the guard when they exceed 100.
 * Totals ≤ 100 are returned unchanged (no-op for normal load/save/display),
 * and totals > 100.5 are a genuine provider anomaly the guard must keep
 * surfacing, so they are also left untouched. Negative weights are never
 * introduced: if the excess exceeds the heaviest row (extreme case) the
