/**
 * Typed context shared by the asset-detail shell (`+layout.svelte`,

 * Exposure / Data).
 *
 * The layout OWNS all data loading: the asset payload, quote, full price
 * history, splits and stored exposure fetched together on mount, the
 * once-per-session `pricesApi.refresh()` with the fresh quote/prices
 * refetch, the isolated `portfolioApi.dashboard()` behind the "Where
 * held" rows, and every mutation the old single page performed — the
 * metadata PATCH (and the shared `form` the prefills write into), the
 * exposure saves/prefills/derives behind `openGeoModal`/`openSectorModal`
 * (the modals themselves are mounted by the layout, mirroring K.4a's
 * transaction modal), and the Yahoo-refresh / backfill / delete header
 * actions. The tabs read the same reactive state through the getters
 * below — nothing is ever fetched twice — and hand user intents back
 * through the methods. View-level derivations (chart series, display
 * exposure lists, "Where held" rows) are re-computed inside the tab that
 * renders them.
 *
 * The state members are getters on purpose: they proxy the layout's
 * `$state`, and only reads performed *in the tab* register as that tab's
 * dependencies. Destructuring the context would snapshot the values and
 * silently break reactivity.
