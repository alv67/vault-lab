/**
 * Typed context shared by the portfolio-detail shell (`+layout.svelte`,
 * EPIC K.4a, spec §4.2/§6.2) and its four tab pages
 * (Overview / Positions / Activity / Allocation).
 *
 * The layout OWNS all data loading: the portfolio payload, the summary,
 * the transactions page (EPIC I.9 pagination), the monthly/annual TWR
 * buckets (EPIC I.8), the value history, the three allocation endpoints
 * (EPIC I.7), the once-per-session `pricesApi.refresh(id)` and every
 * post-mutation refetch (E.9). The tabs read the same reactive state
 * through the getters below — nothing is ever fetched twice — and hand
 * user intents (pagination, add/edit transaction) back through the
 * methods. View-level derivations (position rows, exposure-bar rows,
 * coverage notes) are re-computed inside the tab that renders them.
 *
 * The state members are getters on purpose: they proxy the layout's
 * `$state`, and only reads performed *in the tab* register as that tab's
 * dependencies. Destructuring the context would snapshot the values and
 * silently break reactivity.
